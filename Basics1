9. Data Tier --> set of data objects and information about their relationship is called data model.
   Every guidewire data model consists of Entity, Entity field and Typelist.
   Entity is a different set of tables that are available.
   Entity Field is a value or set of values used to define the state or nature of a specific instance of the Entity.
      Four general types of entity field
         * Data Key - to store data
         * Foreign Key - to refer an entity
         * Array Key - to refer array of entity
         * Type Key - to refer typelist.
         
Platform level entities "eti" are common to all guidewire applications. These are system files and can not be modifiable.
   But the eti files in extensions folder can be modfiable.
Application level entities "eix" are specific to applications.
Entities extension "etx" are addons to the existing entities.
Once extension is created on eti file then etx file will be created in extensions folder.

Guidwire uses Jetty server by default in all of the guidewire products. If needs to change the server from jetty to TomCat or 
other server then needs set in configuration. In guidewire, both application and database uses the same server.
