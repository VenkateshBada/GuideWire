        >java -jar h2-1.2.147.jar
        This will bring-up a login menu. The jdbc url on the login menu should match with one in database-config.xml 
        (/PolicyCenter/modules/configuration/config)
*  Either only one of guidewire studio or database server can run at a given time, as both use the same Jetty server. 
   The second one gets the error that the resources are not available. So stop the server that is not required and run the other one.
*  To regenerate the data dictionary goto /PolicyCenter/bin and use gwpc.bat enter the following command in terminal. 
    gwpc regen-dictionary 
    This will create/update build folder inside the PolicyCenter folder.

   ../PolicyCenter/build/dictionary/data/index.html

   name of the entity in application, but pc_account is the name in the data dictionary. HouseDetails_Ext in data dictionary is 
   pcx_housedetails_ext.
